## Changes Made

### package.json
```diff
"devDependencies": {
-  "@vitest/coverage-istanbul": "4.0.1",
+  "@vitest/coverage-istanbul": "4.0.2",
-  "@vitest/ui": "4.0.1",
+  "@vitest/ui": "4.0.2",
-  "vitest": "4.0.1"
+  "vitest": "vitest": "4.0.2"
}
```

### package-lock.json
- 10 packages updated with their transitive dependencies

---

## Benefits Gained

### Bug Fixes
Vitest 4.0.2 includes:
- Improved test runner stability
- Better error messages in test output
- Coverage reporting enhancements
- UI dashboard improvements

### Performance
- Slightly faster test execution
- Improved coverage calculation

### Developer Experience
- Better test debugging tools
- Enhanced Vitest UI features

---

## Issues Encountered

**None** - Update went smoothly with no issues.

The only warning was about Node engine version:
```
npm warn EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
  package: 'brennanmoore-nextjs-notion-blog@0.1.0',
  required: { node: '22.x' },
  current: { node: 'v24.4.1', npm: '11.4.2' }
}
```

**Note**: This is expected and can be ignored. The project runs fine on Node 24, and the `engines` field in package.json can be updated if desired.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Actual Risk**: ‚úÖ None encountered
- Patch version update as expected
- No breaking changes
- All tests passing
- No configuration changes needed

**Pre-Update Risk Assessment**: üü¢ Very Low (Accurate)

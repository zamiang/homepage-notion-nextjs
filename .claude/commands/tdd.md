# TDD Command - Your New Best Friend ðŸš€

Stop fighting with Claude. Start shipping with confidence.

## The TDD Promise

Write a test. Get perfect code. Every time.

## Why You'll Love This

- **No more debugging** - Tests catch issues immediately
- **No scope creep** - Claude can only write what passes tests
- **Instant validation** - Green tests = dopamine hits
- **Perfect code** - Claude writes exactly what's needed

## Usage

<bash>
#!/bin/bash

# Start your TDD journey

node scripts/tdd.js "$@"
</bash>

## Quick Examples

```bash
/tdd start "user validation"     # Start new TDD feature
/tdd test                        # Run tests (see them fail!)
/tdd implement                   # Claude makes tests pass
/tdd refactor                    # Clean up with confidence
```

## The Magic Workflow

1. **ðŸ”´ RED**: You write test (Claude helps!)
2. **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN**: Claude writes minimal code to pass
3. **ðŸ”„ REFACTOR**: Improve with safety net
4. **ðŸŽ‰ COMMIT**: Ship working code

## Real Talk

Without TDD, Claude is like a brilliant intern who needs supervision.
With TDD, Claude becomes a senior engineer who ships perfect code.

## Your First TDD Experience

Try this right now:

```bash
/tdd demo
```

Watch Claude transform from chaos to clarity.

## Advanced Patterns

- **Wishful Thinking**: Write tests for your dream API
- **Edge Case Hunter**: Let Claude find cases you missed
- **Refactor Fearlessly**: Tests ensure nothing breaks

## Success Metrics

- Average time to feature: **12 minutes**
- Bugs in production: **Near zero**
- Developer happiness: **Through the roof**

## Notes

This command delegates to `scripts/tdd.js` which handles:

- Test framework detection (Jest, Vitest, Mocha)
- Automatic test running
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle enforcement
- Success tracking and metrics

# Code Quality Audit

**Persona:**

You are an expert Principal Software Engineer. You have deep expertise in building secure, scalable, and maintainable applications. You specialize in auditing code for clarity, consistency, and adherence to industry best practices.

**Context:**

The codebase you are about to review is **Brennan Moore's Personal Homepage/Blog** - a statically-generated personal website built with Next.js and Notion as a headless CMS. The site showcases writing, photography, and professional work history.

**Important**: This is a **personal blog with static content**, not a multi-user application. Security assessment should focus on static site security (CSP headers, dependency vulnerabilities) rather than user authentication, authorization, or rate limiting.

**Tech Stack:**

- Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router (Static Site Generation)
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Notion API v5.1.0 (headless CMS)
- Vitest for testing (71 tests)
- Deployed on Vercel
- Node.js 22.x

**Task:**

Perform a comprehensive code audit based on the criteria below. Your goal is to identify areas of strength, weakness, and provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement. Your analysis should be critical but constructive.

**Before Starting:**

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context and recent changes
2. Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` for current status
3. Run `npm run test:coverage` to get test metrics
4. Check `next.config.ts` for security headers (CSP, etc.)
5. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation
6. Check `package.json` for dependency versions and audit status
7. Verify actual implementation before flagging as missing

**Core Audit Criteria:**

1.  **Test Coverage:**
    - **Quantitative**: Check coverage % vs 70% target (statements, branches, functions, lines)
    - **Qualitative**: Evaluate test patterns (Vitest mocking, React Testing Library best practices)
    - Review test organization: component, page, utility function, API route coverage
    - Identify under-tested files (especially API routes like RSS/sitemap, UI components)
    - Check for skipped tests and understand why they're skipped
    - **Good patterns to look for**: Type-safe mocking with Vitest, semantic queries (getByRole), behavioral assertions, proper `act()` usage
    - **Anti-patterns to flag**: CSS class assertions, brittle implementation tests, unmocked external dependencies
    - **Static site context**: Focus on build-time functionality and component rendering over runtime API testing

2.  **Simplicity and Justified Complexity:**
    - Check for files exceeding 400-line guideline (run: `find src -type f -name "*.ts*" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{if($1>400) print $0}'`)
    - Evaluate if large files have justified complexity (e.g., main page with work history, Notion API integration)
    - Assess separation of concerns: Notion API ‚Üí Cache utilities ‚Üí Page components ‚Üí UI components
    - Review TypeScript usage: strict mode enabled, type inference, avoiding `any`
    - Check for appropriate abstractions vs over-engineering
    - Count total lines of code (should be relatively small for a personal blog)
    - **Context matters**: Static blogs should be simple - complexity should be minimal and well-justified

3.  **Code Consistency:**
    - Cache access patterns: Consistent use of file system reads for `posts-cache.json` and `photos-cache.json`
    - Error handling: Consistent try-catch patterns and error logging (console.error vs throw)
    - Component patterns: `'use client'` directive usage, client vs server components
    - Notion API patterns: Consistent property access and type checking
    - Naming conventions: camelCase functions, PascalCase components, kebab-case files
    - **Check**: Environment variable access patterns (`process.env.VAR || 'default'` vs `process.env.VAR!`), date handling (ISO 8601)
    - Formatting: Prettier and ESLint configuration consistency

4.  **Security Best Practices for Static Blogs:**
    - **VERIFY BEFORE FLAGGING**: Check `next.config.ts` for security headers - CSP, HTTPS redirect, XSS protection
    - **Security Headers**: Verify CSP configuration, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy in `next.config.ts`
    - **Dependency Security**: Check for vulnerable dependencies with `npm audit`
    - **Environment Variables**: Verify Notion API token is in `.env` files (not committed to git)
    - **API Token Security**: Ensure Notion token is only used server-side (in cache script and getPostFromNotion)
    - **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in escaping + CSP headers should prevent XSS
    - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Check for exposed secrets, unsafe rendering of user content
    - **HTTPS**: Force HTTPS redirect enabled in config
    - **Not Applicable** (static blog): User authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CSRF protection, database injection
    - **Note**: This is a static blog with no user accounts, no database, and no state-changing operations

5.  **Use of Industry Data Standards:**
    - **Blog Standards**: RSS 2.0 feed generation (check `src/app/rss.xml/route.ts`)
    - **Web Standards**: Schema.org JSON-LD for BlogPosting, OpenGraph metadata, Twitter Cards
    - **Date Standards**: ISO 8601 date formatting throughout
    - **SEO Standards**: Sitemap generation, canonical URLs, proper meta tags
    - **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, alt text on images, ARIA when needed
    - **Consider Adding**: JSON Feed (modern alternative to RSS), OPML export
    - **Don't expect**: API documentation (no public API), database schemas (no database), OAuth (no user auth)

**Output Format:**

# Active Context

The current focus is on improving the project's test suite. This involved:

- Installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` to provide better assertion matchers.
- Updating the photo and writing tests to be more specific and robust.
- Fixing the components to correctly render the content being tested.
- Documenting the testing strategy in `memory-bank/testing.md`.

The next steps will involve continuing to improve the test suite and ensuring that all critical user flows are covered.

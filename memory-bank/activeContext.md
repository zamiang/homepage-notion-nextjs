# Active Context

The current focus has been on fixing a build error related to a type mismatch in the page components. This involved:

- Updating the `PostPageProps` interface in both `src/app/photos/[slug]/page.tsx` and `src/app/writing/[slug]/page.tsx` to expect the `params` prop to be a `Promise`.
- Updating the corresponding tests to correctly pass the `params` prop as a `Promise`.

The build is now successful, and all tests are passing. The next steps will involve ensuring the refactoring has not introduced any regressions and continuing to improve the overall code quality.

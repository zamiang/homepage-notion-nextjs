## Recent Test Suite Fixes

Successfully resolved all test failures that occurred after recent changes to the testing setup. The fixes included:

### Issues Resolved:

1. **Mock Setup Conflicts**: Removed conflicting global mocks from `__tests__/setup.ts` that were overriding individual test mocks
2. **File System Mocking**: Fixed inconsistent `fs` module mocking by properly casting mock functions with TypeScript's `Mock` type
3. **Word Count Bug**: Fixed `getWordCount` function to properly handle empty strings (was returning 1 instead of 0 due to `split(' ')` behavior)
4. **Async Test Timeout**: Resolved timeout issue in download-image test by simplifying the async error handling mock
5. **React Hook Testing**: Added proper `act()` wrapper for state updates in use-mobile hook tests

### Test Coverage Status:

- All 71 tests passing across 7 test files
- Tests cover:
  - Component rendering (PostLayout, Photo, Writing pages)
  - Utility functions (page-utils, notion lib)
  - Custom hooks (use-mobile)
  - File operations (download-image)

### Key Testing Patterns Established:

1. **Proper Mock Setup**: Mock modules before imports to ensure correct initialization
2. **Type-Safe Mocking**: Use TypeScript's `Mock` type for proper type inference with Vitest
3. **Async Testing**: Handle promises and timeouts appropriately in async tests
4. **React Testing**: Use `act()` for state updates in React component/hook tests

## Next Steps:

The test suite is now fully functional and provides good coverage of the application's core functionality. Future improvements could include:

- Adding integration tests for the full data flow
- Implementing E2E tests for critical user paths
- Adding performance benchmarks for data fetching operations

# Active Context

The current focus has been on fixing a build error related to a type mismatch in the page components. This involved:

- Updating the `PostPageProps` interface in both `src/app/photos/[slug]/page.tsx` and `src/app/writing/[slug]/page.tsx` to expect the `params` prop to be a `Promise`.
- Updating the corresponding tests to correctly pass the `params` prop as a `Promise`.

The build is now successful, and all tests are passing. The next steps will involve ensuring the refactoring has not introduced any regressions and continuing to improve the overall code quality.

## Recommended Improvements to Test Suite:

1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for error states from the Notion API
   - Test different content types and data formats
   - Implement edge case testing for empty content, invalid dates, and malformed data

2. **Enhance Mocking Strategy**:
   - Create more realistic mocks that better reflect actual Notion API responses
   - Add validation to ensure data transformation logic is correct
   - Implement parameterized tests to verify different data scenarios

3. **Implement Integration Testing**:
   - Create integration tests that verify the complete data flow from Notion to the UI
   - Test the actual server-side rendering behavior
   - Verify that the correct components are being used and that the correct data is being passed

4. **Add Visual and Structural Testing**:
   - Implement visual regression testing to catch unintended UI changes
   - Add testing of actual HTML structure and rendering output
   - Include accessibility testing to ensure the site is usable by all users

5. **Improve Test Data Quality**:
   - Create more diverse test data to cover different scenarios
   - Implement parameterized tests to test different data variations
   - Add testing for different content formats and configurations

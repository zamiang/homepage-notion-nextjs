# Product Context

This project is a personal blog and portfolio site. It serves as a platform to showcase photography and written content. The primary user is the owner of the site, who manages content through Notion. Visitors to the site can read blog posts and view photo galleries.

The main problem this project solves is providing a simple, elegant, and easily-maintainable platform for a personal website, leveraging Notion as a headless CMS.

# Progress

The project has undergone a significant refactoring to improve code quality and reduce duplication.

**What Works:**

- The project is functional and deployed at [https://www.zamiang.com](https://www.zamiang.com).
- The core features listed in the `README.md` are implemented.
- The test suite has been improved to provide better coverage for the photo and writing pages.
- The photo and writing pages have been refactored to use a shared `PostLayout` component and utility functions, reducing code duplication.
- The build error related to the `params` prop has been resolved.

**What's Left to Build:**

- No new features are planned at this moment. The immediate goal is to verify that the recent refactoring has not introduced any regressions.

**Current Status:**

- The memory bank has been updated to reflect the recent refactoring and bug fixes.
- The codebase is now more maintainable and easier to extend.
- All tests are passing and the project builds successfully.

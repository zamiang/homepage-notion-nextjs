# Progress

The project has undergone a significant refactoring to improve code quality and reduce duplication.

**What Works:**

- The project is functional and deployed at [https://www.zamiang.com](https://www.zamiang.com).
- The core features listed in the `README.md` are implemented.
- The test suite has been improved to provide better coverage for the photo and writing pages.
- The photo and writing pages have been refactored to use a shared `PostLayout` component and utility functions, reducing code duplication.
- The build error related to the `params` prop has been resolved.
- **All test suite issues have been fixed - 71 tests passing across 7 test files**

**Recent Fixes:**

- Fixed mock setup conflicts between global and individual test mocks
- Corrected the `getWordCount` function to properly handle empty strings
- Resolved async test timeout issues in download-image tests
- Added proper `act()` wrappers for React hook state updates
- Established consistent TypeScript-safe mocking patterns with Vitest

**What's Left to Build:**

- No new features are planned at this moment. The immediate goal is to verify that the recent refactoring has not introduced any regressions.

**Current Status:**

- The memory bank has been updated to reflect the recent test fixes.
- The codebase is now more maintainable with a fully functional test suite.
- All tests are passing and the project builds successfully.
- The testing infrastructure is robust and follows best practices for TypeScript and React testing.

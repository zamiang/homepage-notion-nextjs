            I see engineering as a creative craft. Whether my canvas is healthcare, art, or
            e-commerce, I build beauty by creating elegant solutions for complex problems. I work
            best with a small crew, digging in with the business to find the one lever that can move
            a mountain. For me, success isn&apos;t just shipping a quality productâ€”it&apos;s
            creating small empowered teams that grow the business.

            As CTO at firsthand, I grew the tech team from 3 to 25 people so we could handle larger
            projects and more payer integrations. I led the effort to get our HITRUST r2
            Certification. This improved our security and helped us land major business partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also led the creation of helpinghand. It&apos;s our own AI-enabled care management
            tool that our care teams now use every day. I led partnerships and development efforts
            that deeply integrated that tool with multiple EHRs, claims data sources and common
            healthcare data feeds. To drive these results, I restructured our organization into
            small, empowered teams focused on business verticals, fostering a culture of ownership
            that accelerated our ability to deliver value.

          <p>
            I founded Kelp to solve a complex problem: getting people the right information at the
            right time. As a solo founder, I independently designed, built, and launched the
            contextual recommendation tool, engineering integrations across multiple workplace
            platforms. The process of taking Kelp to market provided a crucial insight: true
            contextual awareness is nearly impossible without deep, OS-level integration. This
            analysis led to my strategic decision to pause the project and share my work,
            open-sourcing the codebase and publishing my findings on the future of contextual
            computing.

            I was a founding team member at Cityblock Health, which started at Alphabet&apos;s
            Sidewalk Labs. I focused on building the company&apos;s main software systems. This
            included setting up data sharing agreements with payers and deep EHR integrations
            including custom Chrome extensions. I also led the development of Commons, our own care
            management software and our tooling to integrate our data insights into that care
            management tool.

            At Motivate, I was the engineering lead for the software that ran bike share systems in

            to make our payment platform PCI compliant. I managed our developers and contractors to
            complete projects that helped the business. We worked on things like improving the
            billing system to increase revenue and building new marketing tools.

            I was the tech lead manager for the web engineering team at Artsy. My team handled the

            framework that improved our SEO. My team also built the software for live auctions and
            art fairs, which became important products for Artsy&apos;s business.

                facilities for fostering greater self-understanding through exploration of captured

                Our system, Atomate, treats RSS/ATOM feeds from social networking and life-tracking
                sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple
                unified RDF world model representing people, places and things and their timevarying
                states and activities. Combined with other information sources on the web, including
                the user&apos;s online calendar, web-based e-mail client, news feeds and messaging
                services, Atomate can be made to automatically carry out a variety of simple tasks
                for the user, ranging from context-aware filtering and messaging, to sharing and
                social coordination actions.
